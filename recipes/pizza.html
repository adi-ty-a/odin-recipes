    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>
        <li>4 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1/2 cup salsa</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes,diced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced jalapeno pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 2 pie plates with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Place ground beef, onion, and garlic in a skillet over medium heat. Cook until beef is evenly browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Season beef with chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Lay one tortilla in each pie plate, and cover with a layer of refried beans. Spread 1/2 of the seasoned ground beef over each one, and then cover with a second tortilla. Bake in the preheated oven until tortillas are crisp, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pizzas from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. Then spread 1/2 of the salsa over each top tortilla. Cover each pizza with 1/2 of the Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. Place 1/2 of the tomatoes, 1/2 of the green onions, and 1/2 of the jalapeño slices onto each one.</li>
        <li>Return pizzas to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 to 10 more minutes. Let pizzas cool slightly before slicing each one into 4 pieces.</li>
    </ol>
